# Introduction

Equicord is a community project and welcomes any kind of contribution from anyone!

All contributions should be made in accordance with our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## How to contribute

Contributions are submitted through pull requests. If you are new to Git or GitHub, we recommend reading [this guide](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github).

Pull requests can target either the `main` or `dev` branch.  
Unless you are experienced and know what you are doing, **always target `main`**. The `dev` branch may contain unstable changes and can be force-pushed frequently, which may break your pull request.

## Writing a Plugin

Developing a plugin is the primary way to contribute.

Before starting your plugin:

- Join our Discord server.
- Check existing pull requests to avoid duplicate work.
- Check the [plugin requests tracker](https://discord.com/channels/1173279886065029291/1419347113745059961) to see if your idea already exists or was rejected.
- If no request exists, open one and clearly state that you want to work on it yourself.
- Wait for feedback before starting development, as some ideas may not be accepted or may need adjustments.
- Familiarize yourself with the plugin rules below.

> [!WARNING]
> Skipping these steps may result in your plugin being rejected, even if it is technically correct.

## Plugin Rules

## Improve ryncord itself

If you have any ideas on how to improve ryncord itself, or want to propose a new plugin API, feel free to open a feature request so we can discuss.

## Improving Equicord Itself

If you want to improve Equicord beyond plugins, such as internal features or performance improvements, you are welcome to open a feature request so it can be discussed.

Bug fixes, refactors, and documentation improvements are also highly appreciated!

## Helping the Community

We have an open support channel in our [Discord community](https://equicord.org/discord).
Helping out users there is always appreciated! The more, the merrier.
